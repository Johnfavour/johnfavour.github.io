       My name is Chukwuemeka Favour Mesoma<br>
       The name of my music website is Egonic, <br>
       and what inspired me to start a music project<br> 
       was my love for music. The name of my music website<br> 
       was inspired by the fusion of two powerful elements, which is; <br>
       Individuality and sonic expression.<br>
       'Ego' represents the confidence and authenticity we encourage<br> 
       artists to embrace as they create and share their unique sounds. <br>
       The term 'Egonic' draws from the word 'sonic', emphasizing the focus<br> 
       on sound and the auditory experience that lies at the heart of our platform. <br>
       Through our platform, we invite you to explore the limitless possibilities of sound, immerse yourself in <br>
       transformative melodies, and uncover the magic that lies within the intersection of Ego and Sonic.
